                Artifical Acqusitions is a corporation that strives to allow players to set and obtain their own goals. 
                We try to enable players to have the freedom to do what they want, when they want, and how they want.
                However there are times when we must restrict what's allowed for the safety of everyone envolved, and wormholes just happen to be one of those cases.
                The goal of these rules is not to limit what you as a player can do, but instead to help ensure the safety of you, your ship, and your precious cargo.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page is here to serve multiple purposes. 
                For players new to wormholes we will provide information on important things to know about, such as D-Scan, Wormhole-Rolling, etc.
                We also want to form a cohesive set of rules that everyone can follow. Rules that will help ensure the safety of our people.

            <h3>Use D-Scan</h3>
            <p>
                Wormholes do not offer any way to see who is in the system with you.
                The only way to be aware of your surroundings is to use the Direction Scanner tool.
                This tool is not infalable, simple counter measures like cloaking devices can easily negate it's effectiveness, but it's still the best way to know when danger is coming.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have never used the D-Scanner before, then let me tell you the basics. You can open it by hitting <i>V</i> on your keyboard, or clicking the scanners button to the left of your capacitor while in space.
                Set the tool to scan the maximum range, as well as 360 degrees around your ship.
                Make sure your overview shows all ship types, as the D-Scan uses the same settings as it.
                Finally, Click "Scan" or hit V on your keyboard. Make sure to constantly check D-Scan while inside of the wormhole!

            <h3>You. Will. Die.</h3>
            <p>
               This is just an unfortunate fact about wormhole space. Like null-sec there are no restrictions on PvP combat, other then the ship limitations provided by wormholes themselves. 
               This means that anybody who is not docked is a target for someone with an twitchy trigger finger. 
               Never fly anything you aren't willing to lose, and always be prepared to lose it. 
               Never blame others for not defending you, watching the hole closely enough, or anything of the such.
               Don't blame yourself for the same reasons.
               Wormholes are dangerous places, and death is unavoidable.

            <h3>Name Your ship</h3>
            <p>
                The name of your ship should be changed for 2 very important reasons. 
                The first being that having a ship such as "Slamma009's Porpoise" means that any player in the Wormhole now knows who they are fighting.
                You might not think this is important, but simple information like that can lead to large implication for your safety.
            </p>
            <p>

                The second reason is much more straight forward. If we all use the same name then anything we see on D-Scan will be known as friendly... for the most part.
                It's not impossible that someone would copy our ship names, so just because someone shares your name doesn't mean they're a friend. Always stay alert!

            <h3>Never Use Local Chat</h3>
            <p>
                One of the largest benefits of wormholes is that no one appears in the local chat. This is also one of the most dangerous parts about it.
                Someone could be in your wormhole right now, cloaked up and watching you, and you would never know. 
                By typing in local chat, you're broadcasting to everyone there, telling them "Hey, look I'm in this wormhole right now".
                Don't give them that advantage, stay hidden, and don't use local chat.

            <h3>Don't go AFK</h3>
            <p>
                With immenent danger all around it's important to stay alert. 
                You should always be prepared to warp yourself to safety if the need arises.
                This is a fact in  all of EvE, but especially in wormholes.
                If you need to leave for a bathroom break, to grab some water, anything;
                either warp to a safe and cloak yourself, or simply dock at the station.

            <h3>If Enemies are around. Dock. Up.</h3>
            <p>
                PvPers have a different mindset then you or I. 
                Fighting them only encourages them, killing them makes them want to come back. 
                The best way to get rid of them is to ignore them. To dock up and wait them out.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we've connected to a system filled with enemies, we should keep eyes on the wormhole at all times.
                We should try to NOT show ourselves to them if possible, and certainly not engage them.
                Rolling a wormhole with enemies on the other side will only attract attention, as those people in local will see 1 character coming in and out of their system constantly.
                It's best not to provoke them, and instead let the wormhole die naturally over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                If enemies are currently in our Wormhole, then unfortunately it's time to dock up.
                There's nothing you can do (to be finished...)
